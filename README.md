# SwiftSpell

A work in progress spelling and API guidelines checker for Swift code.

Further development:
- improve basic spelling checks using `/usr/share/dict` dictionaries (need to see what we have on non-darwin platforms) 
- investigate WordNet-based spell checking (need to figure out how to store data files)
- collect popular tech jargon dictionary from C/C++, Cocoa and Swift libraries
- build API guideline checker (research needed) 
- integrate some advanced checker for comment blocks (research needed)
